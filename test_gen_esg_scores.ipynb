      "Based on the context provided, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Climate Neutrality by 2050' would be assessed as MEDIUM. While the company has set science-based targets to reduce GHG emissions in its own operations and is working with suppliers to reduce emissions in the supply chain, there is no explicit mention of a full transition to renewable energy or zero-emission operations by 2050. The company's actions focus on emission reductions and sustainability initiatives, but there is a lack of clear commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2050.\n",
      "Based on the context provided, the company's level of compliance with the goal of achieving a 55% emissions reduction by 2030 would be assessed as LOW. While the company has set science-based targets and initiatives to reduce emissions in its own operations and supply chain, the specific reduction target of 55% by 2030 is not explicitly mentioned or addressed in the context. Additionally, the information provided indicates that the company is on track to meet its current goals, but there is no clear indication of a plan or strategy in place to achieve a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030. Therefore, based on the lack of specific information related to the 55% emissions reduction goal, the company's compliance level would be considered LOW.\n",
      "Based on the context provided, the company's level of compliance with the goal of achieving a 90% emissions reduction by 2040 would be assessed as LOW. While the company has set science-based targets to reduce GHG emissions in its own operations and has engaged suppliers in initiatives like Project Gigaton to avoid emissions, there is no clear indication that they are on track to achieve a 90% reduction by 2040. The focus seems to be on incremental reductions and collaboration with suppliers, but there is no explicit strategy outlined to meet the ambitious 90% reduction target within the specified timeframe. Therefore, the company's compliance level would be considered LOW.\n",
      "Based on the context provided, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)' is LOW. The company mentions setting science-based targets to reduce emissions in their operations and working with suppliers to reduce emissions in their supply chain. However, there is no clear indication of full ETS participation or significant reduction in emission permits purchased. The focus seems to be more on setting goals and driving action rather than actual emissions cuts through ETS participation. Therefore, the company's compliance with the ETS goal is deemed low.\n",
      "Based on the context provided, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Increase Renewable Energy Share' would be rated as MEDIUM. The company has made significant investments in renewable energy projects, with a substantial number of on-site and off-site renewable projects in operation or under development. Additionally, they have completed contracts for new solar and wind projects that will add a significant amount of renewable generation capacity. However, the specific percentage of renewable energy in their operations is not explicitly stated, so a full assessment of 100% compliance cannot be confirmed.\n"
