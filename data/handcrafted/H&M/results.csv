Goal,Compliance,Explanation
Climate Neutrality by 2050,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Climate Neutrality by 2050' is assessed as MEDIUM. While the company has set ambitious targets and aims to achieve a climate positive value chain by 2040, there is no explicit mention of a full transition to renewable energy or zero-emission operations by 2050. The focus seems to be on reducing emissions and implementing sustainable practices rather than completely eliminating emissions. Therefore, the company's compliance level is rated as MEDIUM."
55% Emissions Reduction by 2030,HIGH,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of '55% Emissions Reduction by 2030' is assessed as HIGH. The company aims to reduce its absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 56 percent by 2030, which exceeds the 55% reduction target. Additionally, the company is actively engaged in various initiatives and partnerships to reduce emissions, invest in renewable energy, and support climate action. The company's commitment to reducing emissions and its advanced efforts in carbon capture technologies indicate a high level of compliance with the specified goal."
90% Emissions Reduction by 2040,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of '90% Emissions Reduction by 2040' is assessed as MEDIUM. While the company has set ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 56% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2040, there is no clear indication that they are on track to achieve a 90% reduction by 2040. The company mentions investing in carbon removal initiatives to balance out the remaining 10% of emissions after achieving the 2040 target, indicating a reliance on external compensations rather than direct emissions reduction efforts. Therefore, the company's compliance level is assessed as MEDIUM."
EU Emissions Trading System (ETS),MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)' is assessed as MEDIUM. The company has shown moderate reliance on ETS, reduced permits, and gradual compliance with climate change mitigation efforts. While they have made efforts to reduce emissions and align with technical screening criteria, there is room for improvement in fully participating in ETS and further reducing emission permits purchased."
Increase Renewable Energy Share,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Increase Renewable Energy Share' is at a MEDIUM level. The company has made progress in sourcing renewable energy for its operations, with 96% of electricity purchased being renewable. Additionally, the company is working with suppliers to increase the share of renewable energy sourced by the supply chain. While the company has not yet reached 100% renewable energy in operations, they are making efforts to gradually raise the bar on sourcing renewable energy."
Reduce Energy Dependence from Russia,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Reduce Energy Dependence from Russia' is assessed as MEDIUM. The company has made efforts to gradually phase out coal and fossil fuels in its supply chain, invest in sustainably sourced materials, and increase the share of renewable energy sourced by its supply chain. However, there is still a significant reliance on fossil fuels in many production countries, indicating only partial diversification and reduced reliance on Russian energy. Further efforts are needed to achieve high compliance by completely diversifying and relying on renewable-based energy sourcing."
Circular Economy,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Circular Economy' is assessed as MEDIUM. The company has made progress in optimizing resource use, increasing recycling efforts, and implementing circular design principles. However, there is room for improvement in terms of scaling recycling capacity, developing local recycling infrastructure, and increasing traceability of material waste within the value chain. Overall, the company demonstrates moderate recycling and waste reduction practices, but there is still work to be done to achieve zero-waste production and high efficiency in resource recycling."
Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM),LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)' is LOW. The company's focus on natural and technological carbon sinks, such as preserving forests and exploring new innovations, does not directly address the implementation of CBAM practices to minimize carbon footprint globally. There is no mention of efforts to reduce emissions in the company's own operations or supply chain, nor is there any indication of compliance with CBAM practices. Additionally, the decision not to continue involvement in projects related to carbon sinks due to unclear links to the supply chain suggests a lack of commitment to addressing carbon emissions on a global scale. Therefore, the company's compliance with CBAM practices is deemed LOW."
Just Transition Mechanism,LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Just Transition Mechanism' is assessed as LOW. This assessment is based on the lack of specific information or evidence related to the reskilling/upskilling of the workforce with no job losses, which is a key criteria for high compliance. Additionally, there is no mention of efforts to prevent significant job losses or ensure a smooth transition for employees, indicating minimal efforts in this regard. Therefore, the company's compliance level with the goal of 'Just Transition Mechanism' is deemed to be LOW."
Farm to Fork Strategy,LOW,"Based on the provided context, it is difficult to determine the company's level of compliance with the 'Farm to Fork Strategy' goal. The context primarily focuses on sustainability practices, supplier relationships, and industry tools, but does not provide specific information related to farming practices or the company's approach to the Farm to Fork Strategy. Therefore, I don't know the company's level of compliance with this specific goal."
Zero Pollution Action Plan,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the 'Zero Pollution Action Plan' goal can be assessed as MEDIUM. The company has made efforts to reduce water consumption and improve water quality in its operations and supply chain. It has set water reduction targets, collaborated with organizations like WWF and the 2030 Water Resources Group, and implemented water efficiency projects with suppliers. Additionally, the company has taken steps to ensure compliance with Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals wastewater parameters. However, there are challenges such as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on water performance and delays in investments in new technology for water use improvement. Overall, while the company is making progress in reducing pollution and improving water management, there are areas where further improvement is needed to achieve zero pollution emissions and exceed regulatory standards."
Social Climate Fund,HIGH,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Social Climate Fund' would be assessed as HIGH. This is because the company has fully implemented energy-efficient technologies for all households, specifically transitioning to LED lighting to reduce environmental impact and health risks. Additionally, the company has aligned its economic activities with climate change mitigation and has implemented pollution prevention and control measures. The company also complies with minimum safeguards related to human rights and business ethics, ensuring promotion and respect for human rights throughout its value chain. Overall, the company's efforts align with the goal of promoting social and environmental sustainability, indicating a high level of compliance."
