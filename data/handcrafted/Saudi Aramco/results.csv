Goal,Compliance,Explanation
Climate Neutrality by 2050,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Climate Neutrality by 2050' is assessed as MEDIUM. This assessment is based on the company's focus on low-carbon intensity operations, supporting transitions to low-impact energy pathways, and developing low-impact value chains. While the company is investing in technology and patents in the oil and gas industry to reduce emissions and deploy technologies at scale, there is no explicit mention of a full transition to renewable energy or zero-emission operations by 2050. Additionally, the reliance on offsets and carbon credits suggests that significant emission reductions may be achieved, but not to the extent of full climate neutrality."
55% Emissions Reduction by 2030,HIGH,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of '55% Emissions Reduction by 2030' is assessed as MEDIUM. The company has outlined initiatives to achieve reductions in GHG emissions through various levers such as energy efficiency, methane and flaring reductions, increased use of renewable energy sources, CCUS, and offsets. While the company has made progress in implementing energy efficiency initiatives and methane reduction commitments, there is a lack of specific information on the extent of emission reductions achieved or planned. Without clear data on the actual percentage of emissions reduction achieved or targeted, it is difficult to determine if the company meets the HIGH compliance criteria. Therefore, based on the available information, the company's compliance level is assessed as MEDIUM."
90% Emissions Reduction by 2040,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of '90% Emissions Reduction by 2040' is assessed as MEDIUM. While the company has a clear ambition to reduce carbon emissions associated with its operations and has implemented various strategies such as investing in low-emission technologies, energy efficiency programs, and energy mix diversification, there is no specific mention of a target or plan to achieve a 90% emissions reduction by 2040. The focus seems to be on reducing emissions intensity and improving efficiency rather than setting a specific target for emissions reduction. Additionally, the company mentions working with customers and partners to offer products that support low-carbon fuels, indicating a reliance on external collaborations for emissions reduction. Therefore, the company's compliance level is assessed as MEDIUM."
EU Emissions Trading System (ETS),MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)' is MEDIUM. The company is focusing on reducing emissions through various initiatives such as energy efficiency, methane and flaring reduction, renewable energy investments, carbon capture, utilization, and storage. They are also investing in low-carbon fuels and transport technologies like Gasoline Compression Ignition engines and mobile carbon capture technology. While they are making efforts to reduce emissions and support low-impact energy pathways, the context does not provide clear evidence of full ETS participation or a significant reduction in emission permits purchased, which would indicate high compliance. Therefore, the company's compliance level is assessed as MEDIUM."
Increase Renewable Energy Share,HIGH,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Increase Renewable Energy Share' is at a MEDIUM level. This is supported by the company's investments in renewable energy sources, such as solar PV and wind projects, as well as the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates. While the company is making progress in increasing its renewable energy share, it does not yet meet the criteria for HIGH compliance, which would require 100% renewable energy in operations."
Reduce Energy Dependence from Russia,MEDIUM,"Based on the context provided, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Reduce Energy Dependence from Russia' is assessed as MEDIUM. This assessment is based on the company's initiatives to increase the use of renewable energy sources, such as investments in solar PV and wind projects, purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates, and evaluation of new renewable energy projects. While the company is making efforts to diversify its energy sources, there is no explicit mention of reducing dependence specifically on Russian energy sources. Therefore, the compliance level is considered medium as there is partial diversification with reduced reliance on Russian energy, but not complete diversification as required for high compliance."
Circular Economy,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Circular Economy' is assessed as MEDIUM. The company has made progress in implementing circular economy principles in various aspects of its operations, such as waste management, procurement, and supply chain management. They have implemented initiatives to recycle materials, refurbish equipment, and reduce waste generation. While they have shown improvement in waste minimization, there is still room for further enhancement in resource recycling and efficiency to achieve a higher level of compliance."
Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM),LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is assessed as LOW. This assessment is based on the fact that the company mentions initiatives to reduce emissions intensity and support carbon pricing mechanisms, but there is no clear indication of full adoption of CBAM practices to minimize carbon footprint globally. Additionally, the company's focus on maintaining low carbon intensity in its operations does not necessarily translate to full compliance with CBAM practices. Therefore, the company's compliance level is deemed LOW as it does not demonstrate full adoption of CBAM practices."
Just Transition Mechanism,HIGH,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Just Transition Mechanism' is assessed as MEDIUM. This assessment is based on the company's efforts to reduce GHG emissions, improve energy efficiency, minimize flaring and methane emissions, invest in renewable energy projects, and engage in sustainability initiatives. While the company is making progress in these areas, there is no specific mention of reskilling/upskilling of the workforce with no job losses, which is a key criteria for HIGH compliance. Therefore, the company's compliance level is rated as MEDIUM."
Farm to Fork Strategy,LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Farm to Fork Strategy' is not clear. The context primarily focuses on sustainability governance, climate change, safe operations, and minimizing environmental impact. There is no direct mention of the company's specific practices related to the 'Farm to Fork Strategy' or sustainable farming methods. Therefore, I don't have enough information to determine the company's compliance level with respect to this goal."
Zero Pollution Action Plan,HIGH,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the 'Zero Pollution Action Plan' goal is assessed as HIGH. The company has implemented various measures to monitor and reduce emissions of sulfur oxide (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They have set emission thresholds, monitor emissions, and have plans in place to further reduce emissions through investments in projects like Vapor Recovery Units and Vapor Handling Facilities. Additionally, they have implemented a vapor recovery system to minimize VOC emissions and are working on enhancing sulfur recovery to reduce SOx emissions. Overall, the company is proactive in exceeding regulatory standards and has a comprehensive approach to minimizing pollution emissions."
Social Climate Fund,LOW,"Based on the provided context, I don't have enough information to determine the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Social Climate Fund'."
Critical Raw Materials Act,LOW,"Based on the provided context, I don't have enough information to determine the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Critical Raw Materials Act'."
