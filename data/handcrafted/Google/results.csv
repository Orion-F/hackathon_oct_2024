Goal,Compliance,Explanation
Climate Neutrality by 2050,HIGH,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Climate Neutrality by 2050' is assessed as MEDIUM. This assessment is based on the company's significant efforts to reduce emissions and transition to renewable energy, as evidenced by their commitment to achieving net-zero emissions across all operations and value chain by 2030. However, the context does not provide explicit information about a full transition to renewable energy and zero-emission operations by 2050, which would indicate HIGH compliance. Therefore, the company's compliance level is considered MEDIUM."
55% Emissions Reduction by 2030,LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of '55% Emissions Reduction by 2030' would be assessed as LOW. The company's target is to reduce 50% of its combined Scope 1, 2 (market-based), and 3 absolute GHG emissions before 2030. In 2022, the total GHG emissions were reported at 10.2 million tCO2e, but due to a methodology change, they are not reporting a percent progress towards this target for 2022. The company mentions improvements made to their Scope 3 accounting methodology, but these changes are not applied to prior years, and had they not made these changes, their reported 2022 Scope 3 emissions would have been approximately 18% higher. Additionally, their Scope 2 (market-based) emissions increased by 37% in 2022. Overall, the lack of specific progress towards the 55% emissions reduction goal and the increase in emissions in certain areas indicate a low level of compliance with the specified goal."
90% Emissions Reduction by 2040,LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of '90% Emissions Reduction by 2040' is LOW. The company has set a target to reduce 50% of its combined Scope 1, 2 (market-based), and 3 absolute GHG emissions before 2030, but there is no clear strategy or information provided on how they plan to achieve a 90% reduction by 2040. Additionally, the company's reported total GHG emissions for 2022 were approximately 10.2 million tCO2e, which does not indicate significant progress towards a 90% reduction by 2040. Therefore, based on the lack of a clear strategy and insufficient progress, the company's compliance level is assessed as LOW."
EU Emissions Trading System (ETS),MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)' is MEDIUM. This assessment is based on the company's efforts towards reducing emissions, purchasing renewable energy, and setting targets for carbon neutrality. The company has shown moderate reliance on emission trading, reduced permits, and gradual compliance with environmental criteria. However, the context does not provide specific details on the company's full participation in the ETS or significant reductions in emission permits purchased, hence the assessment of MEDIUM compliance."
Increase Renewable Energy Share,HIGH,"Based on the context provided, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Increase Renewable Energy Share' is HIGH. The company has made significant investments in renewable energy projects, signed renewable energy deals, and is actively advocating for clean energy policies. They have also achieved the milestone of matching 100% of their electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases for four consecutive years. Additionally, they have committed to operating on carbon-free energy 24/7 by 2030. Overall, the company has demonstrated a strong commitment to increasing their renewable energy share and has taken concrete actions to achieve this goal."
Reduce Energy Dependence from Russia,LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Reduce Energy Dependence from Russia' is assessed as LOW. This assessment is based on the fact that the company has focused on achieving renewable energy targets and reducing carbon emissions, but there is no specific mention of diversifying energy sources away from Russian energy. The company's efforts are primarily centered around renewable energy procurement and carbon neutrality, with no explicit mention of reducing dependence on Russian energy sources. Therefore, the company's compliance level with the specified goal is deemed LOW."
Circular Economy,HIGH,"Based on the context provided, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Circular Economy' is HIGH. The company has outlined a robust and data-efficient model for waste/recyclables detection, supports partners in accelerating circular economy solutions, and has launched accelerators focused on circular economy solutions. Additionally, the company emphasizes maximizing the reuse of finite resources across its operations, products, and supply chains, and promotes healthy materials and safe chemistry. The company's approach includes designing out waste, keeping products and materials in use, and embedding circular economy principles across its infrastructure, operations, and products. Overall, the company's commitment to accelerating the transition to a circular economy and its efforts to minimize waste and maximize reuse of materials demonstrate a high level of compliance with the circular economy goal."
Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM),HIGH,"Based on the provided context, the company demonstrates a HIGH level of compliance with the goal of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The company is actively engaged in reducing its carbon footprint globally, advocating for stronger clean energy and climate policies, and partnering with organizations to accelerate clean energy and climate progress.

Additionally, they are involved in various initiatives and partnerships to promote low-carbon economies and drive emissions reductions. Overall, the company's actions align with the criteria for HIGH compliance with CBAM practices."
Just Transition Mechanism,LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Just Transition Mechanism' is assessed as LOW. The context does not provide any specific information or initiatives related to reskilling/upskilling of the workforce to avoid job losses. There is no mention of efforts to ensure a smooth transition for employees in case of changes due to climate transition plans. Therefore, the company's compliance with the goal of 'Just Transition Mechanism' is deemed to be minimal, resulting in potential significant job losses and region stagnation."
Farm to Fork Strategy,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Farm to Fork Strategy' is assessed as MEDIUM. This is because the company mentions engagement with external targets and initiatives related to sustainable supply chains, supplier capacity building, training, and corrective action plans, and supplier environmental assessment-related targets. While the company shows some commitment to sustainability and environmental factors within its supply chain, there is limited information on the specific sustainable farming practices or innovations related to the 'Farm to Fork Strategy'.
