Goal,Compliance,Explanation
Climate Neutrality by 2050,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Climate Neutrality by 2050' would be assessed as MEDIUM. While the company has set science-based targets to reduce GHG emissions in its own operations and is working with suppliers to reduce emissions in the supply chain, there is no explicit mention of a full transition to renewable energy or zero-emission operations by 2050. The focus seems to be on emission reduction rather than complete neutrality. Additionally, the analysis conducted only considered scenarios up to 2050 without a clear commitment to achieving climate neutrality by that year. Therefore, the company's compliance level would be considered MEDIUM."
55% Emissions Reduction by 2030,LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of '55% Emissions Reduction by 2030' is assessed as LOW. The information primarily focuses on the company's efforts to reduce emissions through initiatives like Project Gigaton and setting science-based targets. However, there is no specific mention of a plan or target to achieve a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030. Without a clear actionable plan or target in place to meet the specified goal, the company's compliance level is deemed low."
90% Emissions Reduction by 2040,LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of '90% Emissions Reduction by 2040' is assessed as LOW. While the company has set science-based targets to reduce GHG emissions in its own operations by 18% by 2025 and has engaged suppliers in initiatives like Project Gigaton to avoid emissions, there is no clear strategy or mention of specific plans to achieve a 90% emissions reduction by 2040. The focus seems to be on incremental reductions and collaborative efforts rather than a bold and clear strategy to meet the ambitious 90% reduction target. Therefore, the company's compliance level is deemed LOW."
EU Emissions Trading System (ETS),LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)' is assessed as LOW. The company mentions setting a science-based target to reduce emissions in its operations and working with suppliers to reduce emissions in the supply chain. However, there is no clear indication of full ETS participation or a significant reduction in emission permits purchased. The focus seems to be more on setting targets and working with suppliers rather than actively participating in emission trading to achieve real emissions cuts. Therefore, the company's compliance level with the ETS goal is deemed LOW."
Increase Renewable Energy Share,MEDIUM,"Based on the context provided, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Increase Renewable Energy Share' is at a MEDIUM level. This is because the company has made significant investments in renewable energy projects, with over 520 on-site and off-site renewable projects in operation or under development in 8 countries. Additionally, they have completed contracts for new solar and wind projects that will add a substantial amount of renewable generation capacity. While they have not achieved 100% renewable energy in operations, their efforts in increasing renewable energy share demonstrate a medium level of compliance with the goal."
Reduce Energy Dependence from Russia,LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Reduce Energy Dependence from Russia' is LOW. There is no specific mention of efforts to diversify energy sourcing or reduce reliance on Russian energy. The focus is primarily on internal controls, safety, cybersecurity, and climate change mitigation through renewable energy initiatives. Therefore, the company's compliance with reducing energy dependence from Russia is minimal, indicating LOW compliance."
Circular Economy,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Circular Economy' is assessed as MEDIUM. The company has set goals to achieve zero waste to landfill or incineration in multiple markets by 2025 and has made efforts to divert food waste and packaging waste. They have also engaged in initiatives to accelerate the adoption of circular packaging and products. While they have made progress in diverting waste from landfills and incineration globally, there is still room for improvement in achieving zero waste production and high efficiency in resource recycling, which are characteristics of high compliance. Therefore, the company's compliance level falls under the MEDIUM category."
Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM),MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is assessed as MEDIUM. The company has set science-based targets to reduce GHG emissions in its own operations and is working with suppliers to reduce emissions in its supply chain. While the company has made progress in reducing emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy, there is no specific mention of full adoption of CBAM practices or minimizing carbon footprint globally. Therefore, the company's compliance level is considered MEDIUM as it shows partial compliance with moderate shifts to greener imports."
Just Transition Mechanism,LOW,"Based on the provided context, it is difficult to determine the company's level of compliance with the goal of 'Just Transition Mechanism' as there is no specific information related to reskilling/upskilling of the workforce or job losses. Therefore, I don't know."
Farm to Fork Strategy,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Farm to Fork Strategy' is assessed as MEDIUM. While the company has shown commitment to sustainable practices in its supply chain, such as requiring suppliers to achieve certification to internationally recognized food safety standards, there is limited information specifically addressing sustainable farming practices. Without explicit mention of sustainable farming methods or practices, it is difficult to determine if the company has a high level of compliance with the goal. Therefore, the assessment is based on the limited information available, indicating a medium level of compliance."
Zero Pollution Action Plan,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the 'Zero Pollution Action Plan' goal is MEDIUM. While the company has set science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and is actively working with suppliers to reduce emissions in the supply chain through initiatives like Project Gigaton, there is no specific mention of a Zero Pollution Action Plan or efforts to achieve zero pollution emissions. Therefore, the company's compliance level is considered MEDIUM as they are making moderate reductions in pollution and complying with minimum standards."
Social Climate Fund,LOW,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with the goal 'Social Climate Fund' is LOW. There is no specific mention of the company implementing energy-efficient technologies for households or supporting vulnerable groups in the context. The focus is primarily on governance practices, ethics, compliance, and climate change initiatives. Therefore, the company's compliance with the goal of 'Social Climate Fund' is minimal, leading to inequality."
Critical Raw Materials Act,MEDIUM,"Based on the provided context, the company's level of compliance with respect to the goal 'Critical Raw Materials Act' is assessed as MEDIUM. This assessment is based on the fact that the company conducts regular audits and assigns color ratings to facilities based on compliance levels. While the company does take steps to address noncompliances found in audits and engages in dialogue with suppliers to remediate violations, there is still a significant percentage of facilities (10.8%) that receive orange ratings indicating more serious violations. Additionally, the company has stopped doing business with more than 30 suppliers due to serious violations since 2012. This indicates that there are gaps in compliance with the goal of ensuring sustainable and secure supply chains with zero environmental harm."
