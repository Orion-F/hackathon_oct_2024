Goal,Description,HIGH Compliance,MEDIUM Compliance,LOW Compliance
Climate Neutrality by 2050,EU Climate Law: Binding goal for zero emissions by 2050,Full transition to renewable energy; zero-emission operations by 2050,Significant emission reductions but reliance on offset schemes,Limited action with minimal emission reductions
55% Emissions Reduction by 2030,EU Climate Law: Target for a 55% reduction of GHG emissions,55%+ reduction in emissions; advanced use of carbon capture tech,Achieving 35%-45% emission reductions,Emission reductions under 20%; lack of actionable plans
90% Emissions Reduction by 2040,Intermediate target set by the European Commission,Exceed 90% reduction by 2040 with early compliance,Working toward compliance but reliant on external compensations,No clear strategy to meet the 2040 target
EU Emissions Trading System (ETS),Cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions across industries,Full ETS participation and reduction in emission permits purchased,"Moderate reliance on ETS, reduced permits, and gradual compliance",Over-reliance on emission trading without real emissions cuts
Increase Renewable Energy Share,"REPowerEU plan: Boost solar, wind, and hydrogen energy production",100% renewable energy in operations; strong investments in R&D,Mixed energy portfolio with growing renewable investments,Continued heavy reliance on fossil fuels
Reduce Energy Dependence from Russia,Diversification of energy sources and energy efficiency improvements,Completely diversified and renewable-based energy sourcing,Partial diversification with reduced reliance on Russian energy,No significant diversification; continued use of fossil fuels
Circular Economy,EU Circular Economy Action Plan: Promote sustainable resource use and waste reduction,Zero-waste production; high efficiency in resource recycling,Moderate recycling and waste reduction practices,High waste production with limited recycling
Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM),Imposing carbon taxes on imported goods to prevent carbon leakage,"Full adoption of CBAM practices, minimizing carbon footprint globally",Partial compliance with moderate shifts to greener imports,Outsourcing emissions-heavy production to countries with lax standards
Just Transition Mechanism,Support regions and workers affected by the green transition,Complete reskilling/upskilling of workforce with no job losses,"Partial retraining efforts, some job losses, limited transition","Minimal efforts, resulting in significant job losses and region stagnation"
Farm to Fork Strategy,"Create a sustainable, healthy, and fair food system",Sustainable farming practices with no negative environmental impact,"Adoption of some sustainable practices, but limited innovation",Continued use of harmful farming methods with environmental degradation
Zero Pollution Action Plan,"Reduce air, water, and soil pollution",Zero pollution emissions; proactive efforts to exceed regulatory standards,Moderate reductions in pollution; compliance with minimum standards,High pollution levels with no significant reduction efforts
Social Climate Fund,Financial support for vulnerable households during the transition,Full implementation of energy-efficient technologies for all households,Limited improvements in energy efficiency for select groups,"Minimal support for vulnerable groups, leading to inequality"
Critical Raw Materials Act,Ensure supply chain security for green technologies,Fully sustainable and secure supply chains with zero environmental harm,"Partial reliance on sustainable supply chains, with some gaps",Dependence on unsustainable and conflict-prone materials
